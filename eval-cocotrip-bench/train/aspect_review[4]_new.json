          "itemA": "The 2-bed condos are spacious and offer a relaxing experience away from the Strip, while the lake-facing units feature large covered patios perfect for enjoying coffee. Although the rooms are very comfortable, some beds squeak, and the thin walls make it easy to hear noises from nearby rooms. One major complaint is that guests on the upper floors were noisy and partied all night.",
          "itemB": "The rooms lacked a mini-fridge, but are equipped with a high-quality pull-out couch, although some rooms can be noisy due to proximity to air conditioning units and a delivery door."
